This is a standard PC, no markings, you can buy this at any store, any computer outlet to get into the computer and look at the back, make sure that all your connectors, when you lay the computer down, all the connectors are on the bottom.
These are thumbscrews. You unscrew them out of the song and you slide back and then lift up. Just takes the case off.
Now, this is the inside of a computer.
You have a power supply and these connectors come off the power supply power to everything on the system and on the components. This is a processor fan Heat Sync, which is over the microprocessor.
There's several components around here that we'll talk about later. You have your hard drive, you have your CD-ROM. And this is this component down here is called your motherboard. We're going to take this part.
The blue cables that you see here are called SATA cables. That's Atah Sata cables. There's a pin on the top of one of the you squeeze and pull the pin here. What you do is you squeeze that pin down and you pull out and it comes off of the hard drive to take the power which has the same type of connector only uses a little bit longer. We do the same thing up top, squeezable, same thing with the power squeeze and pull the power supply through the power supply.
The SATA cable is supplied through the system. Boy, there's these cables here. You see the cables are connected to, say, the ports that are on the system board again, squeeze and you pull Sethi's off to the side as well.
We're going to start disconnecting power to everything.
This power cord right here connects to a case fan. They simply just unplug this power connector connects all the power to the system more squeeze and pull directly out. It's got this little clip that clips onto the side of the system for, again, another case fan and plug power.
And you have a four prong power connector down here, supplies more power to the board. It also has a little squeeze and it pulls right out. Now, your power supply is completely disconnected from your system.
Boy, now we're going to remove the power supply, OK?
To remove the power supply. There are four screws on the back side. Your Phillips screwdriver.
Make sure you don't lose your screwed. Once you finish taking out all four screws, you just follow a slight forward tilt back towards the board, left straight out it. That is the removal of the power supply. Now, this remove the drive.
Normally, there are two screws that hold power supply spying on either side, top and bottom. Let's remove the hard drives screws and remove the hard rock.
Slides forward and your hard drives been removed if you have screws on the on the other side of the opposite side, stand the computer back up, remove the screws on the on what we call the bottom side, remove your thumb screws, slide the tray, open up that portion of your computer.
These two screws will release the CD-ROM drive. The background. Two screws on this side. Once you remove the screws from the seat, your own push from the back forward and you see your arm slide forward now to remove the system, or you can first have to remove each one of the components that are tied to it cables, PCI connectors or PCI express whatever external cards or what they call adult cards. You have to remove them. This is considered memory doesn't necessarily have to be removed when you're removing the motherboard, but you can to remove the memory.
There's a tab on either side. You pull the tab out, pull this tab on the other side out and the memory slides right out. There's your memory stick. Now we're going to remove this PCI card. To do that, you'll see the screws inside here. It's hard to get to. There's a cover on the back side and we have to remove first. This is not normal on an all out all computer. Some of the the big box computers do not have the most custom cut cases will remove your case.
It exposes all your screws you find which one has the the silver tab that usually indicates an add on card and screw it back into the case. Grab both corners and pull straight out. This will take your car, you PCI card off of the system more. Now, most of the cables that you see here come from the front panel, the front panel has a card reader. It's got USB ports, audio, headphone, jack. It's got a power button, a power leidy's or power light.
And it's got indicators for your hard drive. Another lights on the front. So what we want to do is disconnect those cables from your system for real. Simply don't you don't pull too hard. Just grab firmly and ease them out. Just pull lightly and they'll all unplug and notice how they found a part. This is your USB cables, do the same thing, grab lightly and pull these do not faint apart and it has the word USB or has the the letters USB.
All this will tell you these are for the USB ports and the card reader for a front. Then this cable again from here it tells you that it's an audio port came from here and it will tell you on the system board where it says audio.
Now, let's remove the motherboard to remove the the system or there's screws that hold it on, these screws are indicated by little circles throughout the system more and that holds it in place.
So it won't it can't move.
And once we remove those screws, the system boards should slide towards the front of the case and pull straight out.
I'm using a slightly magnetic tipped screwdriver to kind of help some people out. Don't necessarily think that should be used. And if that's the case, you don't feel comfortable with that then and don't use them. I'm sure whenever you're putting the screws back in and you don't, you know, overtake them, they just need to be tightened up enough to where they hold steady, not to lift straight up.
Now that you have your system bought out, you can replace your processor. This is the easiest way to do it. I like to put the processor in the heat sink on before I set my motherboard back in my box or or replace it. The reason being is allow me one to handle the device a little easier. And two, I'm not confined in space. So what I want to do is on on every heat sink, you're going to find a fan.
That fan usually has a power cord and it's usually plugged in to a power connector. And it'll tell you on the on the system boards or CPU fan should be plugged into.
This is on an anti static bag so that you don't, you know, any static electricity to the system or unplug your power again. If you don't have to yank on them, just slightly pull them out. There's a screw inside each one of these that you can remove the fan. Some people remove the fan or you can just remove it by this. Take that level and.
